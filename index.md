## Do I need to be an expert to attend?

Nope. In fact, bring your friends.

## Do I need to be an expert to talk?

Nope. This meetup is supposed to be fun and casual, so we want everyone to
participate.

## What kind of talks are you looking for?

Generally, all talks are welcome. However, the balance we try to meet is:

* **2x Creative Talks**: Creative applications of programming, e.g. building a web MIDI Player.
* **1x Passion Talk**: Something you're excited about outside of work, e.g. maintaining the linux kernel. 
* **1x Technical Talk**: A deep dive on a technical topic, e.g. optimizing your code for the V8 engine.

## How do I submit a talk?

1. Comment on the current open [Call for Speakers issue][2].
2. Promote your talk on twitter. Include link to your comment.
3. Use hashtags: `#forloop`, `#forlooptanzania`, `#tanzania`, `#speaking`.

## How long should my talk be?

Ten minutes. There won't be any formal Q&A; we encourage attendees to ask
questions in person later. We also try to introduce you well enough so you can
speed through any self-bio slides.

## What should be in my talk submission?

Just a few sentences describing what you want to talk about would be great.

## What happens after I submit my talk?

We will follow up with you via email! It may take a few days.

## What's the A/V situation?

We'll have HDMI to plug into (for video and audio) and a mic for you to use.
Let us know if you need any fancy adapters (we'll have some Apple ones).

## Do I need to submit my slides beforehand?

Nope, but please show up at least 1 hour before your talk.
